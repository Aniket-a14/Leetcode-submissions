# 🚀 LeetCode Solutions

Welcome to my LeetCode practice repository!  
This repository contains my solutions to a wide range of LeetCode problems that I solve regularly to strengthen my Data Structures and Algorithms skills.

My focus is not just on solving problems, but on understanding patterns, improving problem-solving speed, and writing clean, efficient code.

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository

This repo serves as a personal learning archive where I:

- Practice coding interview questions consistently  
- Improve algorithmic thinking and optimization skills  
- Revisit important problem-solving patterns  
- Track my progress over time  

It reflects my journey of continuous learning and discipline in competitive programming and technical interview preparation.

## 💻 Programming Language

Most of the solutions in this repository are written in:

**C++**

I prefer C++ because of its performance, powerful STL, and its widespread use in coding interviews and competitive programming.

## 🧠 What Each Solution Includes

Whenever possible, each solution contains:

- A clear and readable implementation  
- An optimized approach instead of brute force (where applicable)  
- Helpful inline comments  
- Time and Space Complexity analysis  

The goal is to make the solutions easy to revise before interviews.
